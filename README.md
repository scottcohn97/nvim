# Introduction

This is my Neovim configuration for all the platforms I use (Linux, Windows and
MacOS). `init.vim` is the config file for terminal Neovim, and `ginit.vim` is
the additional config file for GUI client of Neovim (I am using
[neovim-qt](https://github.com/equalsraf/neovim-qt) for now on Windows).

My configurations are heavily documented to make it as clear as possible. While
you can download the whole repository and use it, it is not recommended to do
so. Good configurations are personal. Everyone should have his or her unique
config file. You are encouraged to copy from this this repo the part you feel
useful and add it to your own Nvim config.

See [doc here](docs/README.md) on how to install Nvim's dependencies, Nvim
itself and the configuration on different platforms (Linux, MacOS and Windows).
